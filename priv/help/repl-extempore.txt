The Extempore undertone REPL

Built-in functions:

(call body)   -- make an explicitly blocking call to Extempore, with 'body'
                 being a valid Extempore expression
(check-xt)    -- check on the status of Extempore (no response indicates a
                 health problem, possibly requiring a restart of the 'extempore'
                 binary)
(eom)         -- alias for '(term)'
(exit)        -- alias for '(quit)'
(h)           -- alias for '(help)'
(help)        -- display this information
(load file)   -- read the code in the given file and load in the current
                 Extempore session
(quit)        -- quit the Extempore REPL and return to the LFE REPL
(term)        -- send message-terminating character sequence to force Extempore
                 end-of-message (useful when troubleshooting)
(v)           -- alias for '(version)'
(version)     -- display all the version info for undertone

Extempore support:

All S-expressions other than the ones listed above will be treated as Extempore
Scheme / xtlang code and sent to the Extempore TCP server (compiler service) as
an asynchronous call (no result, no output printed). If you would like to block
on particular calls and see their return values, be sure to use the '(call ...)'
REPL function.

Session commands support:

(sess)           -- show the list of the recent REPL commands entered this
                    session
(sess n)         -- show the last n entries for the REPL command history of the
                    current session
(sess-line n)    -- show the nth-from-last entry in the session's REPL commands
                    (n = 1 gives the last entry; n = 4 gives the fourth-to-last,
                    etc.)
(sess-load file) -- load previously-saved session entries from a file
(sess-save file) -- save the session entries to a file
(rerun n)        -- re-run an entry from the REPL session with the given index;
                    to get the correct index, run '(sess)' or '(sess n)'
